- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

- Inheritance allows for a more organized program
- I could reuse code from the parent class, but implementing and initializing specific traits for the sub classes were a bit hard. I would tell someone to start small, and run throughout the code writing process.
